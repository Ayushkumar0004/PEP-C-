#include<iostream>
// Includes the standard input-output stream library to enable the use of `cout` for printing.

using namespace std;
// Specifies that the program will use the standard namespace, so you donâ€™t need to use `std::` before standard functions.

int main() 
// Defines the `main` function, which serves as the entry point of the program.

        // Declares a local (non-static) integer variable `b` and initializes it to 0.
